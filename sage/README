This folder contains some scripts that are written in Sage. They are written
that way for simplicity.

counting.py
  This script is for counting the total number H_{13}-patterned graphs given
  that we have a folder containing the output of writetofiles.py  and the extra
  file real-3-5-13-26.g6 which contains the graph6-string of H_{13}.

count_orbits.py
  Reads some graph6-strings of graphs from stdin and counts the number of
  orbits in each of those graph's automorphism groups. Then also gives the sum
  of numbers of orbits over all graphs given in stdin.

writetofiles.py
  Scipt for taking the output of "proper" program and writing the result to
  several different files of the form real-3-*-*-*.g6, depending on the
  independence number, order and size of the graph. This does not calculate the
  independence number of the graphs (should be given as first part of each
  line) since that was a bottleneck for quite large graphs.
  - Note! If one wants to use counting.py on this later one should also make a
    separate file real-3-5-13-26.g6 for H_{13} in the same directory as the
    other files.
